# Podcast iOS Client 

Podcast is another app from [Cornell AppDev](http://cornellappdev.com), a project team at Cornell University. It is a podcast client that seeks to transform the way you listen to, interact with, and share and discover podcast content.

## Development
### Installation
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for our dependency manager. This should be installed before continuing.

After cloning the project, `cd` into the new directory and install dependencies with
```
pod install
```
Open the Podcast Xcode workspace, `Podcast.xcworkspace`, and enjoy!
